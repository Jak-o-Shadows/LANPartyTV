# LANPartyTV
Yo! This is a simple set of static webpages that show the games that people have in common. Using the SteamAPI, each user's games list is downloaded. This is then permutated with every combination of people. Then you can select people, and see the games in common in a web-browser - perfect for showing on the TV.


You need to do:
checkout
make "app" folder
make "combs" folder
make "avatar" folder
create "STEAMAPI.txt" file, and put your steam API key in there
create "userids.txt" file, with the steam ID of all your friends (that you care about) in it on a newline each
run gen.py
